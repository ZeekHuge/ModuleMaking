The loadable modules in this directory are developed by my, while learning the kernel programming.

To build the modules:
	1. If your kernel headers source is installed at '/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build', the build command will be :

			$make 

	2. If your kernel headers source is installed at some other location, the build command will be :

			$ KDIR=/path/to/source make
